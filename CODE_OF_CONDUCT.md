# Glossary

A rule of thumb on how to edit glossaries:

- **Clarity**: Add terms that may be ambiguous or subject to interpretation to prevent misunderstanding and conflicts.
- **Accessibility**: More accessible to a wider audience, including newcomers and may not be familiar with certain technical terminology.
- **Consistency**: Promoting consistency in communication within this project by ensuring that everyone uses terms in the same way. Fostering a cohesive and inclusive community.
- **Reference**: Easer to reference key terms as needed, without having to search for definitions elsewhere.
- **Transparency**: It is a sign of commitment to transparency and clarity in this project's governance and communication practices.
