    Cross-cutting concerns
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Aspects of a program affect multiple parts of the system and can't be cleanly contained within just one module or component. These aspects often get mixed into many different areas of the code, leading to two main problems:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scattering AKA code duplication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tangling AKA tight coupling.
      </li>
    </ul>
    E.g. authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and general data format validation.
